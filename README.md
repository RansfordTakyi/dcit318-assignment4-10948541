Explanation of Development Process on Ubuntu OS

Introduction
This document explains the development process I followed to complete the DCIT 318 Assignment 4 tasks on an Ubuntu operating system. Due to the lack of a built-in visual designer for Windows Forms on Ubuntu, I had to manually generate the Form1.Designer.cs files and use the Mono framework to compile and run the applications. Below are the detailed steps and considerations involved in this process.

Development Environment
Operating System: Ubuntu
Development Framework: Mono (an open-source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework)
Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Task Breakdown and Manual Form Creation
The assignment required the creation of three separate Windows Forms applications:

Login Screen:

Two text boxes for username and password.
A login button that displays a message box with the entered username and password.
Address Book Application:

Text boxes for entering name, email, and phone number.
A button to save the entered information.
Drawing Application:

Allows users to draw on a canvas using the mouse.
Captures mouse events to draw lines or shapes on the form.
Manual Creation of Designer Files
Due to the absence of a visual designer, I manually created the .Designer.cs files. These files include the initialization and configuration of form controls, which would typically be auto-generated by a visual designer tool.
